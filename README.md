  Added starting files where I have created a small logo (to be reviewed) and added styling to the nav
  No wireframes for the design as I'm just taking it as it comes.
  Feel free to add whatever you wish and we can review the design as we go

I redesigned the navbar with collapsing function. this could be implemented into the index file. I didnt add it in because some of your css was interfering with mine. I will work at trying to figure out why it is clashing when i finish work today.

added in the body and footer content to your restyled nav. Not finding any conflicts. Just lemme know if you find any conflicts with the css. Might have been the selector for the styling on the html and body as I originally had it in a collective html,body{} but maybe separating them was a good idea    

# Updated logos - lemme know what you think is better. In the circle or just plain text
