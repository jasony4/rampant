  Added starting files where I have created a small logo (to be reviewed) and added styling to the nav
  No wireframes for the design as I'm just taking it as it comes.
  Feel free to add whatever you wish and we can review the design as we go


#I redesigned the navbar with collapsing function. this could be implemented into the index file. I didnt add it in because some of your css was interfering with mine. I will work at trying to figure out why it is clashing when i finish work today.
